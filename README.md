# FYDP- Fourth Year Design Project 

Test code, cases and files for fourth year design project: 
The goal is to successfully recover two mixed speech signals from an unknown source using existing Blind Source Separation Algorithms(BSS) in MATLAB 
The project contains cases for manual mixing, where the mixing ration is reprsented by a 2x2 matrix and an unknown mixing matrix. 
The files contained in this project are test .wav files and different test cases using exisitng independent component analysis (ICA)
