# FYDP- Fourth Year Design Project 

Test code and cases for fourth year design project: 
The goal is to successfully recover two mixed speech signals from an unknown sourceusing existing Blind Source Separation Algorithms(BSS)
The project contains cases for manual mixing, where the mixing ration is reprsented by a 2x2 matrix and an unknown mixing matrix. 
The friles contained in theis project are test .wav files and different test cases using exisitng independent component analysis (ICA)
